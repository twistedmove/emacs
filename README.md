Introduction
============

This page contains my Emacs configuration.

I recommend to use the Emacs version from
[Railwaycat](https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port)'s port,
which provides a native GUI support for latest Mac OSX.

In general, I use [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) as my
default Emacs configuration for keyboard shortcuts, Latex, C/C++,
HTML/CSS, Python and Org.

In addition, I use Emacs as my main editor for coding Matlab.

Installation
============

1. Download and install [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude);
2. Copy all files to the fold `~/.emacs.d/personal`;
3. Restart Emacs.
